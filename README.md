# Spam-Classification

The dataset that was used for this project is the Enron email dataset. You can find the full dataset on the web here: http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/. The dataset is a collection of public domain emails from the Enron corporation. The emails have been manually classified as spam and non-spam. The primary goal of the project is to create a supervised classification pipeline to classify emails as spam or non-spam from the training data.
